# FoodOasisGroupB
Food Oasis is a proposed Android app that aims to alleviate the effect of food deserts on the dietary health of people in low-income areas. It will use the Google Places API to search for grocery stores and farmers' markets in the vicinity of a given location. It will filter these results by cost. In addition, to make sure it does not return convenience stores and fast food restaurants, the app will verify location results against USDA databases of grocers and farmer's markets. Additional proposed features include being able to save favorite locations and notifications with links to weekly grocery ads for these locations.
